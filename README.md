# PlayNarrative

> A mindful gaming library that transforms how players engage with their hobby.

**PlayNarrative** is a personal gaming archive that organizes games by *engagement type* (Story, Completion, Online MP, Social, Cozy/Life Sim), empowering users to choose what to play based on their desired experience or current mood—not obligation. The app combines mental health-aware UX design with personal narrative features, allowing players to reflect, leave notes, and build a living archive of their gaming journey.

Built with **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, and **JPA**, this project demonstrates full-stack development skills while showcasing a unique product philosophy: games aren't just items in a list—they're experiences that deserve mindful engagement.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Engagement-Centric Organization**: Games organized by experience type, not just platform or name
- **Personal Narrative**: Reflection notes and badges transform your library into a living story
- **Mindful UX**: Collapsible sections, lightweight cards, and calm design reduce backlog anxiety
- **Scalable Design**: Handles 50+ active games and 300+ archived titles without overwhelm
- **Visual Identity**: Color-coded engagement types and icon-driven navigation

## 🎯 Philosophy

PlayNarrative is built on four core ideals:

1. **Intentional Play**: Choose games based on desired experience, not obligation
2. **Mental Health Awareness**: Reduce completionist pressure and backlog anxiety
3. **Personal Narrative**: Build a reflective archive of your gaming journey
4. **Scannability**: Find the right game quickly, even with large libraries

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
