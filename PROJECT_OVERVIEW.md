# PlayNarrative — Personal Gaming Archive

## Portfolio Summary (1-2 Paragraphs)

**PlayNarrative** is a mindful gaming library that transforms how players engage with their hobby. Unlike traditional trackers that prioritize completion stats and backlog pressure, PlayNarrative organizes games by *engagement type* (Story, Completion, Online MP, Social, Cozy/Life Sim), empowering users to choose what to play based on their desired experience or current mood—not obligation. The app combines mental health-aware UX design with personal narrative features, allowing players to reflect, leave notes, and build a living archive of their gaming journey. With scalable design that handles 50+ active games and 300+ archived titles without overwhelm, PlayNarrative turns a collection into a thoughtful, intentional story of play.

Built with **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, and **JPA**, the project demonstrates full-stack development skills while showcasing a unique product philosophy: games aren't just items in a list—they're experiences that deserve mindful engagement. The design features color-coded engagement types, accordion-based navigation, reflection badges, and conversational UI elements that make the app instantly recognizable and portfolio-ready. This project showcases the ability to translate a wellness-focused philosophy into functional, scalable software, making it ideal for demonstrating both technical competency and product thinking to potential employers or collaborators.

## Extended Overview

### Core Philosophy

PlayNarrative is a personalized gaming library and tracker designed to help gamers engage with their hobby intentionally, mindfully, and reflectively. Unlike traditional game trackers that focus solely on completion or statistics, PlayNarrative prioritizes the experience, mental well-being, and personal narrative of each gamer.

#### 1. Intentional Play
- Games are categorized by engagement type (Story, Completion, Online MP, Social, Cozy/Life Sim).
- Users choose what to play based on desired experience or mood, not obligation.

#### 2. Mental Health Awareness
- Designed to reduce backlog anxiety and completionist pressure.
- Features like collapsible sections, lightweight cards, and optional mood/energy indicators help keep the experience calm and mindful.

#### 3. Personal Narrative
- The library functions as a living archive, where users can reflect, leave notes, and track milestones.
- Over time, users can see their gaming journey and patterns, transforming a collection into a story of play.

#### 4. Scannable and Usable at Scale
- Even with large libraries (50+ active games, 300+ archived), the UI remains organized and intuitive.
- Engagement-focused sections, accordion cards, and smart filtering allow users to find the right game quickly.
